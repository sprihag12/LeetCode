Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/report-contiguous-dates/

Solution:
select period_state,to_char(start_date,'yyyy-mm-dd') as start_date,
to_char(end_date,'yyyy-mm-dd') as end_date from
(select 'succeeded' as period_state ,min(success_date) as start_date,max(success_date) as end_date  from
(select success_date,success_date-rownum as pd,
rank() over(partition by success_date-rownum order by success_date) as rk1,
rank() over(partition by success_date-rownum order by success_date desc) as rk2
from Succeeded 
where success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31')
where rk1=1 or rk2=1
group by pd

union

select 'failed' as period_state ,min(fail_date) as start_date,max(fail_date) as end_date  from
(select fail_date,fail_date-rownum as pd,
rank() over(partition by fail_date-rownum order by fail_date) as rk1,
rank() over(partition by fail_date-rownum order by fail_date desc) as rk2
from Failed
