Solution 1:

select sum(TIV_2016) as TIV_2016 from insurance
where TIV_2015 in
(select TIV_2015 from insurance
group by TIV_2015 
having count(pid)>1)
and pid not in
(select pid from insurance
where (lat,lon) in
(select lat,lon from insurance
group by lat,lon 
having count(pid)>1))

Solution 2:

select sum(TIV_2016) as TIV_2016 from
(select pid,TIV_2016,TIV_2015 ,count(pid) over(partition by TIV_2015 ) as ct1,
count(pid) over(partition by lat||lon ) as ct2
from insurance)
where ct1>1 and ct2=1
