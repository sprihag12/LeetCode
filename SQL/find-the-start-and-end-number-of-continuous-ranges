Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-start-and-end-number-of-continuous-ranges/

Solution:

with cte as
(select log_id,lead(log_id) over(order by log_id) as ld, 
lag(log_id) over(order by log_id) as lg from logs)

select y.log_id as start_id   ,x.log_id as end_id     from
(select log_id,rownum as rn from
(select log_id,case when ld is null then 'end'
     when abs(log_id-ld)<>1 then 'end' 
     end as t from cte)
where t='end') x  join
(select log_id,rownum as rn from
(select log_id,case when lg is null then 'start'
     when abs(log_id-lg)<>1 then 'start' 
     end as t from cte)
where t='start') y on x.rn=y.rn
